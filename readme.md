I have used Scilab for some minor data handling and measurment tasks.
This repository containts the cleaned up version of the code I used.
Mostly very specific tasks, often with a gui.

## data_viewer
For a past project, we did measuremts on electric bikes.
I wrote a gui so I could have a quick look at the data before processing it.
It made it easy to check if measuremts where succesful and useful.

## kalman_filter
scilab code written after reading [this tutorial](http://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/).
Some more explanation [here](https://wordpress.com/post/learnscilab.wordpress.com/224).
