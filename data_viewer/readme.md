## convert data
This script puts the data in a nice format for the data viewer. Raw data that is measured / logged by an arduino for example is divided in to separate files. In addition an header with variable names is added.

Originally it also did some conversion of voltages to measured values, but I left that out for simplicity.
(It was moved to the arduino part of the code.)

## gui.sce
Run this script to use the data viewer.
